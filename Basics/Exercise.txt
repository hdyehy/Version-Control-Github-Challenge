1. The terminal is basically the computer without the GUI (graphical user interface). you can do anything you could do outside of the terminal, in the terminal. Like make new files, copy and delete files, create folders, search for folders and items, turn off settings and much more. The terminal is very useful for precise actions , i.e. deleting all files that start with ' A' or create many empty folders at once. It also is very fast and more productive than navigating the GUI at times.

2. Git is an open source Version Control System. In short, it operates by having users clone the full repository and history to their own computers from a host master server. they can then make edits to their own cloned repository and push those changes to the master. this protects the data because if the master server ever goes down then there is backups that can be pulled. Github is a website, that is hosted by a company, that hosts Git repositories as the master server.

3. We use Github because it makes using git a whole lot more seamless, by taking out the expensive and time consuming task of hosting a server. it also makes collaboration easy by acting as a simple and nuetral access point for repositories.
